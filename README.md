# Asteroids

### Project description:
The player is a little rocket ship. He can fire bullets.

The player is either
* restricted to the screen space area, or
* gets teleported to the other side if he goes out of bounds.

Astroids spawn randomly at the edge of the screen and move around.

Enemies spawn occasionally at the edge and go towards the player.

Both asteroids and enemies can be shot.
